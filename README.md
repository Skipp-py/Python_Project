# Python_Project
This project is an exploratory data analysis of Airbnb's online experiences. It is a work in process to understand the which events bring the most value and therefore would be a worthwhile cause. Presentation slides for the analysis can be viewed at (https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-MmG6XC2-UgN1iBwE_YM). This work was produced by David Kressley and is for educational purposes only.
